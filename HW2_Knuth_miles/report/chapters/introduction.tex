\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
The Knuth Miles dataset, compiled by Donald E. Knuth in his seminal work "The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for Combinatorial Computing" (1993), represents a comprehensive collection of distance measurements between 128 major North American cities. This dataset serves as a fundamental resource for studying spatial relationships and network structures in urban geography.

\section{Dataset Overview}
The dataset contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 128 nodes representing major North American cities
    \item Complete pairwise distance measurements between all cities
    \item Additional attributes for each city including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude)
        \item Population data
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Objectives}
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To construct and analyze a weighted undirected graph representation of the Knuth Miles dataset
    \item To examine the network properties and topological characteristics of the city connectivity
    \item To identify key cities based on various centrality measures
    \item To understand the geographical patterns and clustering in the network
    \item To derive insights about urban connectivity and spatial relationships
\end{enumerate}

\section{Report Structure}
This report is organized into four main chapters:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Introduction} (Current Chapter): Provides background information about the dataset and project objectives.
    
    \item \textbf{Exploratory Data Analysis}: Details the data structure, preprocessing steps, and initial analysis of the network properties.
    
    \item \textbf{Centrality Analysis}: Presents a comprehensive analysis of different centrality measures and their implications.
    
    \item \textbf{Discussions and Results}: Synthesizes the findings and discusses their implications for understanding urban networks.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodological Framework}
The analysis employs graph theory and network science methodologies, utilizing the following key components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Network construction using NetworkX
    \item Geographic visualization using Cartopy
    \item Statistical analysis of network properties
    \item Centrality measure calculations
    \item Community detection algorithms
\end{itemize}

This methodological framework allows for a comprehensive examination of the spatial relationships between cities and the underlying structure of the urban network.
