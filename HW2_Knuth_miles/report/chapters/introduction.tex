\section{Dataset Overview}
The Knuth Miles dataset represents a historical transportation network from 1949, containing information about 128 major cities in the United States and Canada. The dataset includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item City names and locations (latitude and longitude)
    \item Population data for each city
    \item A symmetric distance matrix representing the highway distances between cities
\end{itemize}

This dataset was originally part of the Stanford GraphBase and has been widely used in graph theory and network analysis studies. The data provides a snapshot of the transportation infrastructure during a significant period in North American development, just after World War II and during the early stages of the interstate highway system.

\section{Graph Theory Methodology}
The analysis of the Knuth Miles dataset employs several key concepts from graph theory and network analysis:

\subsection{Network Representation}
The transportation network is represented as an undirected, weighted graph $G = (V, E, w)$ where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V$ is the set of vertices (cities)
    \item $E$ is the set of edges (highway connections)
    \item $w$ is the weight function assigning distances to edges
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Network Metrics}
The analysis focuses on several important network metrics:

\subsubsection{Centrality Measures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Degree Centrality}: Measures the number of direct connections to a city
    \item \textbf{Betweenness Centrality}: Quantifies how often a city appears on shortest paths between other cities
    \item \textbf{Closeness Centrality}: Indicates how close a city is to all other cities in the network
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Community Detection}
The Louvain method is employed to identify natural communities in the network, which helps understand regional clustering and transportation patterns.

\subsubsection{Network Properties}
Key properties analyzed include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Network density
    \item Average clustering coefficient
    \item Average shortest path length
    \item Degree distribution
\end{itemize}

\section{Analysis Tools and Techniques}
The analysis is conducted using Python with the following key libraries:
\begin{itemize}
    \item NetworkX for graph analysis and visualization
    \item NumPy for numerical computations
    \item Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
    \item SciPy for statistical analysis
    \item scikit-learn for additional analytical techniques
\end{itemize}

\section{Research Questions}
The analysis addresses several key questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the geographic distribution of cities and how does it relate to population?
    \item How are populations distributed across the network?
    \item What are the structural properties of the transportation network?
    \item Which cities are most central in the network and why?
    \item Are there natural clusters or communities in the network?
    \item How efficient is the highway system in terms of connectivity?
\end{enumerate}

These questions guide the analysis and help uncover insights about the historical transportation network and its implications for urban development and connectivity.
