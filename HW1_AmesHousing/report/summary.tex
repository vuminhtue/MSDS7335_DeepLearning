\begin{frame}{Summary of Ames Housing Analysis Project}

\textbf{Challenges \& Solutions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Neural network initially had negative R² (-3.61); improved to 0.8849 by adding batch normalization, target normalization, and learning rate scheduling
    \item Developed robust preprocessing pipeline for consistent feature handling across models
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Learning Moments:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gained deeper understanding of regularization effects in Ridge vs. Lasso regression
    \item Expanded neural network skills for structured tabular data optimization
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Accomplishment:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed balanced modeling approach with competitive performance across models:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lasso: R²=0.8960 (best feature selection)
        \item Random Forest: R²=0.8901 (captured non-linearity)
        \item Neural Network: R²=0.8849 (after optimization)
        \item Ridge: R²=0.8755 (stable baseline)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Created framework for model selection based on interpretability vs. performance tradeoffs
\end{itemize}
