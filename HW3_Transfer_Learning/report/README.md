- Practical implications and conclusions

## üî® Building the Report

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed:
- **macOS**: MacTeX
- **Windows**: MiKTeX or TeX Live
- **Linux**: TeX Live

### Compilation Options

#### Option 1: Using Makefile (Recommended)
```bash
# Build the PDF report
make

# View the PDF (macOS)
make view

# Clean temporary files
make clean

# Clean everything and rebuild
make rebuild

# Show help
make help
```

#### Option 2: Manual Compilation
```bash
# Compile LaTeX document (run 3 times for proper cross-references)
pdflatex transfer_learning_report.tex
pdflatex transfer_learning_report.tex
pdflatex transfer_learning_report.tex
```

#### Option 3: Using latexmk (if available)
```bash
latexmk -pdf transfer_learning_report.tex
```

## üìä Figures and Images

The report includes:
- Confusion matrix visualization showing perfect classification performance
- Architecture diagrams and tables
- Performance metrics and analysis tables

All images are stored in the `images/` subdirectory and automatically included during compilation.

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Content
1. Edit `transfer_learning_report.tex` to add new sections or modify existing content
2. Add new images to the `images/` directory
3. Update `references.bib` for new citations
4. Recompile using `make` or manual compilation

### Styling Modifications
The report uses:
- 12pt font size with 1.5x line spacing
- 1-inch margins on all sides
- Professional formatting with headers and footers
- Consistent table and figure styling

### Package Dependencies
The document uses standard LaTeX packages:
- `geometry` - Page layout
- `graphicx` - Image inclusion
- `booktabs` - Professional tables
- `hyperref` - Clickable links and references
- `listings` - Code formatting
- `amsmath` - Mathematical typesetting

## üìÑ Output

The compilation process generates:
- `transfer_learning_report.pdf` - Final report document
- Various auxiliary files (`.aux`, `.log`, `.toc`, etc.)

Use `make clean` to remove temporary files while keeping the PDF.

## üéØ Report Highlights

### Key Achievements
