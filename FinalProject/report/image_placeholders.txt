REQUIRED IMAGES FOR LATEX REPORT
=====================================

The LaTeX report references several figures that should be created for a complete document. 
Below are the specifications for each required image:

1. ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM (architecture_diagram.png)
   --------------------------------------------------
   File: architecture_diagram.png
   Size: 800x600 pixels (recommended)
   Content: High-level system architecture showing:
   - Ollama (Local LLM box)
   - Langchain (RAG Framework box)
   - ChromaDB (Vector Database cylinder)
   - Gradio (Web Interface box)
   - Arrows showing data flow between components
   - User interaction arrows
   - Document input and query output flows

2. RAG WORKFLOW DIAGRAM (rag_workflow.png)
   ----------------------------------------
   File: rag_workflow.png
   Size: 1000x700 pixels (recommended)
   Content: Detailed process flow showing:
   - Document Upload → Text Extraction → Chunking
   - Embedding Generation → Vector Storage
   - Query Input → Similarity Search → Context Retrieval
   - LLM Generation → Response Output
   - Include ChromaDB cleanup process
   - Show parallel processing where applicable

3. CURSOR WORKFLOW DIAGRAM (cursor_workflow.png)
   -----------------------------------------------
   File: cursor_workflow.png
   Size: 900x600 pixels (recommended)
   Content: AI-assisted development process showing:
   - Natural Language Requirements (input box)
   - Cursor.com AI Processing (brain/AI icon)
   - Code Generation (code snippets)
   - Integration & Testing (gear icons)
   - Deployment (cloud/server icons)
   - Feedback loop arrows

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS:
=====================

If you cannot create these images immediately, you have several options:

1. COMMENT OUT FIGURE REFERENCES:
   - Open MSDS7335_Final_Report.tex
   - Find the \includegraphics lines
   - Comment them out with % at the beginning
   - Keep the figure captions for reference

2. USE PLACEHOLDER TEXT:
   Replace \includegraphics commands with:
   
   \begin{center}
   \textbf{[Figure Placeholder: Architecture Diagram]}\\
   \textit{High-level system architecture showing integration of Ollama, Langchain, ChromaDB, and Gradio}
   \end{center}

3. CREATE SIMPLE DIAGRAMS:
   - Use draw.io (diagrams.net) - free online diagramming tool
   - Use Lucidchart for professional diagrams
   - Use PowerPoint or Google Slides and export as PNG
   - Use LaTeX's TikZ package for programmatic diagrams

EXAMPLE TIKZ CODE FOR SIMPLE DIAGRAM:
====================================

You can replace image includes with TikZ code directly in LaTeX:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm]
\node (user) [rectangle, draw] {User};
\node (gradio) [rectangle, draw, right of=user] {Gradio UI};
\node (langchain) [rectangle, draw, right of=gradio] {Langchain};
\node (ollama) [rectangle, draw, below of=langchain] {Ollama};
\node (chromadb) [cylinder, draw, above of=langchain] {ChromaDB};

\draw [arrow] (user) -- (gradio);
\draw [arrow] (gradio) -- (langchain);
\draw [arrow] (langchain) -- (ollama);
\draw [arrow] (langchain) -- (chromadb);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Simplified system architecture}
\end{figure}

(Note: Add \usepackage{tikz} to the preamble for TikZ support)

RECOMMENDED TOOLS FOR DIAGRAM CREATION:
======================================

1. **Draw.io (diagrams.net)** - Free, web-based
   - Perfect for architecture diagrams
   - Professional templates available
   - Export to PNG, PDF, SVG

2. **Lucidchart** - Professional diagramming
   - Excellent for complex workflows
   - Collaboration features
   - High-quality exports

3. **Microsoft Visio** - Enterprise diagramming
   - Advanced templates
   - Integration with Office suite

4. **Creately** - Online diagramming
   - Good selection of templates
   - Easy to use interface

5. **LaTeX TikZ** - Programmatic diagrams
   - Perfect integration with LaTeX
   - Scalable vector graphics
   - Professional appearance

PRIORITY ORDER:
==============

1. Create architecture_diagram.png (most important)
2. Create rag_workflow.png (detailed workflow)
3. Create cursor_workflow.png (AI development process)

The report will compile successfully without images, but including them significantly enhances the professional appearance and clarity of the technical content.
