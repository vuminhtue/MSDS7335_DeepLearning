    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Ollama: Local Language Model Infrastructure}

\subsubsection{Overview and Motivation}

Ollama serves as the backbone of our local language model infrastructure, providing a robust platform for running large language models on consumer hardware without requiring external API access \citep{ollama2024}. This choice was motivated by the project's emphasis on data privacy and the need for a solution that could operate entirely within secured network environments.

\subsubsection{Supported Models}

The system supports multiple language models, each optimized for different use cases and computational constraints:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gemma2:1B}: A compact, efficient model suitable for resource-constrained environments
    \item \textbf{DeepSeek-R1:1.5B}: Optimized for reasoning tasks and complex query processing
    \item \textbf{Llama3.2:1B}: Meta's latest compact model with improved instruction following
    \item \textbf{Qwen2.5VL:3B}: Alibaba's multilingual model with enhanced language understanding
    \item \textbf{mxbai-embed-large:335M}: Specialized embedding model for vector representation generation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Performance Characteristics}

The selection of these models represents a careful balance between performance and resource requirements. Table \ref{tab:model_comparison} provides a detailed comparison of the computational requirements and performance characteristics of each model.

\begin{table}[H]

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Langchain: RAG Framework Implementation}

\subsubsection{Framework Architecture}

Langchain provides the foundational framework for implementing the RAG pipeline, offering a comprehensive set of tools for document processing, vector store integration, and query orchestration \citep{chase2023langchain}. The framework's modular architecture allows for easy customization and extension of the RAG workflow.

\subsubsection{Document Processing Pipeline}

The document processing pipeline implemented using Langchain consists of several key stages:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Document Ingestion}: Support for multiple file formats including PDF and plain text
    \item \textbf{Text Extraction}: Robust extraction algorithms handling various document layouts
    \item \textbf{Text Chunking}: Recursive character-based splitting with configurable parameters
    \item \textbf{Metadata Preservation}: Maintenance of source information and document structure
\end{enumerate}

The text chunking strategy employs a recursive approach with the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chunk size: 1000 characters
    \item Overlap: 200 characters
    \item Separators: Paragraph breaks, sentence boundaries, and whitespace
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Retrieval and Generation Integration}

The integration of retrieval and generation components within Langchain follows the RetrievalQA pattern, which provides a standardized interface for combining vector search with language model generation. The system implements a custom prompt template optimized for document-based question answering:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Custom Prompt Template Implementation]
template = """Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. 
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Context:
{context}

Question: {question}

Answer:"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=template,
    input_variables=["context", "question"]
)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{ChromaDB: Vector Database Management}

\subsubsection{Vector Storage Architecture}

ChromaDB serves as the vector database backend, providing efficient storage and retrieval of document embeddings \citep{chromadb2024}. The choice of ChromaDB was motivated by its simplicity, performance, and compatibility with local deployment scenarios.

\subsubsection{Embedding Strategy}

The embedding strategy employs the mxbai-embed-large model to generate high-dimensional vector representations of document chunks. This model was selected for its superior performance on semantic similarity tasks and its relatively modest computational requirements.

\subsubsection{Search and Retrieval}

The retrieval mechanism implements a similarity search using cosine distance metrics, with configurable parameters for result ranking and filtering:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Search depth: Top-4 most similar chunks
    \item Similarity threshold: Dynamically adjusted based on query complexity
    \item Result diversification: Implemented to avoid redundant content
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Gradio: User Interface Development}

\subsubsection{Interface Design Philosophy}

The Gradio-based user interface was designed with simplicity and functionality in mind, providing an intuitive experience for users regardless of their technical background \citep{abid2019gradio}. The interface incorporates modern web design principles while maintaining accessibility standards.

    \caption{Detailed RAG workflow showing the complete process from document upload to answer generation, including all intermediate steps and data transformations.}
    \label{fig:rag_workflow}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Data Processing Pipeline}

The data processing pipeline implements a robust error handling and recovery mechanism to ensure system reliability:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Document Validation}: File format verification and integrity checking
    \item \textbf{Text Extraction}: Fault-tolerant extraction with fallback mechanisms
    \item \textbf{Quality Assessment}: Content quality evaluation and filtering
    \item \textbf{Embedding Generation}: Batch processing with error recovery
    \item \textbf{Storage Management}: Automatic cleanup and optimization
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Query Processing and Response Generation}

The query processing system implements a multi-stage approach to ensure accurate and relevant responses:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Query Analysis}: Intent recognition and complexity assessment
    \item \textbf{Retrieval Strategy}: Dynamic search parameter adjustment
    \item \textbf{Context Assembly}: Intelligent aggregation of retrieved chunks
    \item \textbf{Response Generation}: Temperature-controlled generation with source attribution
    \item \textbf{Quality Assurance}: Response validation and safety filtering
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Performance Optimization and Scalability}

\subsubsection{Memory Management}

The system implements sophisticated memory management strategies to handle large documents and maintain responsive performance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Lazy loading of document embeddings
    \item Dynamic memory allocation for model inference
    \item Garbage collection optimization for long-running sessions
    \item Cache management for frequently accessed chunks
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Concurrent Processing}

To maximize throughput and responsiveness, the system employs concurrent processing techniques:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Asynchronous document processing
    \item Parallel embedding generation
    \item Background model preloading
    \item Non-blocking user interface updates
\end{itemize}

This comprehensive technical foundation provides the necessary infrastructure for implementing a robust, scalable, and user-friendly RAG chatbot system that meets the security and privacy requirements of sensitive data environments.
